The method consists in these steps:
+ Apply Newton's Method $x_{n+1} = x_n - (p(x_n) / p'(x_n))$
+ Compute $p'(x_n)$ using Ruffini's Rule.
+ Evaluate $p(x_n)$ and $p'(x_n)$ using Horner's Method.

An example of this is with the polynom: 
* $x^5 - 8x^4 - 72x^3 + 382x^2 + 272x - 2310$.
* $p'(x) = 5x^4 - 32x^3 - 216x^2 + 764x + 727$
* Evaluate and find a root equals to 2. 
* Deflates the equation with synthetic division and restart Horner method.

With this, we can found all roots, which are -7, -3, 2, 5, 11.
