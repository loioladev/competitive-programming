+ Geometric progression with ratio 2. It can be calculated as follows:
```
f(a[i]) = a[i-1] * 2
```
+ This can be answered by the following [explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8P8uFahAgc). For this pattern to occur, we need a geometric object with no edge intersections. With this, we can use the Euler's Characteristic Formula (V - E + F = 2) and modify it to get the formula *F = 1 + ((n-(n-1))/2) + ((n-(n-1))/4)*.

+ Prime numbers sequence.
