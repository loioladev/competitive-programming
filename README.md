# Competitive Programming

Repository with my structures and codes for problems in competitive programming.

## Problems
I am an enthusiastic problem solver, actively engaging in coding challenges on various platforms, including:

- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com): A competitive programming platform that hosts regular contests and provides a wide range of algorithmic problems.

- [Atcoder](https://atcoder.jp): A popular Japanese competitive programming platform with regular contests.

Additionally, I am currently dedicated to mastering the problem set from the [CSES](https://cses.fi/problemset) and to complete some of the problems in the [Competitive Programming 4](https://cpbook.net/details?cp=4) problems.

My solutions for these challenges are neatly organized in two separate folders, CSES and CP4, respectively. The model I use to solve the problems is found in `model.cpp`.
