I had no ideia to solve this, so I searched and found this [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36693743/given-1-a-10-1-%E2%89%A4-n-%E2%89%A4-100000-show-how-to-compute-the-value-of-1-%C3%97-a-2-%C3%97-a). We can use the formula described, however, it will cause an overflow, so we need to use modular arithmetic to avoid this, and maybe this will solve the problem in O(logn)?
